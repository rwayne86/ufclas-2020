# gutenberg-examples

Examples for extending
[Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg)
with plugins which create blocks.

See also:
[Gutenberg developer documentation](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/handbook/)

For each of the examples that include an `esnext` example the following commands are required to build the plugins:

- `npm install` to install the node packages
- `npm run build` to build the production version of the plugin or `npm run dev` to build a development version of the plugin and watch changes for automatic rebuild
